# KKUVANETScenario
This project “An algorithms for finding new routes selection support” has objective of solving traffic problems in a Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) by using virtual traffic model to propose a solution to traffic congestion problem and comparing the new static and dynamic traffic route search methods on the ad hoc network system. In addition, it has added information gained from changing traffic conditions, such as the number of vehicles, vehicle speed on the road vehicle type and the bus stop. The algorithm, which was improved from the Dijkstra's algorithm, is executed to obtain a new route derived from static and dynamic traffic simulations. The information obtained from the simulated traffics is compared to the survey traffic simulation in KKU. Consequently, a safer and better traffic route has been achieved and can relieve the congestion of vehicles. In condition, the simulation results of the proposed algorithm can make vehicles possible to avoid traffic jams and can help relieve the problem of traffic congestion, reduce fuel consumption, and reduce the rate of the number of vehicles stuck on the road.
